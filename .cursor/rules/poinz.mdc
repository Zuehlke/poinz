# Poinz rules

- we are still using javascript
- if you are working on a js file, do not create a ts file, do everything in the javascript file
- if you are creating new files you must use typescript

- NEVER FINISH BEFORE YOU ARE NOT FINISHED, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR "should I continue?"

- DO NOT EVER SUMMARISE WHAT YOU DID, I SEE IT IN THE CODE CHANGES
